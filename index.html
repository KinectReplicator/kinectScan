        <h3>Welcome to our Project Archive.</h3>

<p>This webpage was created to serve as an electronic archive to the work performed during the Spring semester of 2013 for the Rutgers University Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Senior Capstone Design. </p>

<h3>Project Abstract</h3>

<p>The Microsoft Kinect for Windows has proven to be a valuable tool in the field of computer vision. The Kinect is comprised of an infrared laser projector and depth sensor. The depth data of a scene is run through a bilateral filter and vector mathematics is used to define the coordinates, connecting lines, the vertices, and edges to form a three-dimensional mesh. The software displays the raw depth data and infrared camera image, this allows the user to filter out objects closer or further than a specified depth, and exports the reconstructed three-dimensional mesh. That mesh is then sliced into horizontal layers and converted into G-Code, a machine language that maneuvers the three-dimensional printer where to extrude the ABS plastic to create a physical replica of the reconstructed object. </p>

<h3>Final Report and Summary Video</h3>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>This project was design, created, and implemented in over 300 hours of work by: Ryan Cullinane (<a href="https://github.com/covertPZ" class="user-mention">@covertPZ</a>), Cady Motyka (<a href="https://github.com/cmotyka" class="user-mention">@cmotyka</a>), and Elie Rosen (<a href="https://github.com/erosen" class="user-mention">@erosen</a>). All of which completed their undergraduate degree from the Rutgers Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Program in May of 2013. </p>

<h3>Try our Code</h3>

<p>To run the program:
1. connect a Microsoft Kinect Device to your personal computer. 
2. Download the project from the links at the top. 
3. Navigate to the "Release" folder. 
4. Run the application "KinectScan.exe".</p>

<h3>KinectScan Instructions</h3>

<p>To create a 3-D mesh of the current scene press the "Record Frame" button. To clear a mesh, you may either take another capture or press the "Clear Canvas" button. The sliders may be used to configure how far the Kinect should look back and to create a bounding box to crop a scene. This must be performed before recording a frame. When a desired mesh is captured, fill in the model name box and press "Export Model". The model will export which can then be opened in 3-D software such as <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a>. </p>

<h3>3-D Print a Mesh</h3>

<p>To print the mesh it must first be ran through <a href="http://cloud.netfabb.com/">Netfabb</a> to correctly fill in the volume, the output from this web-based application will make sure that the 3-D scan is oriented correctly and manifold. </p>

<p>Run the new object through a 3-D printer G-code compiler such as <a href="http://slic3r.org/">Slic3r</a> or <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/makerware/">MakerWare</a> which will allow for the mesh to be printed on a 3-D printer.</p>

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
